# Ground state estimation on kagome lattice of Heisenberg model using VQE
This project shoots to estimate the ground state of Heisenberg's Hamiltonian on a kagome lattice using the variationnal quantum eigensolver.

## Roadmap
* Solve the problem classically
* Solve the problem using VQE
* Benchmark results
