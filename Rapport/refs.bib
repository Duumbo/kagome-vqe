Anderson}, abstract = {The possibility of a new kind of electronic state is pointed out, corresponding roughly to Pauling's idea of â€œresonating valence bondsâ€ in metals. As observed by Pauling, a pure state of this type would be insulating; it would represent an alternative state to the NÃ©el antiferromagnetic state for S = 1/2. An estimate of its energy is made in one case.} }
